I’m a software engineer with 6 years of experience in C++ and Python programming, and a hardware designer with a background in Physical Design, VLSI, and Verilog. 
My repository showcases side projects, competition entries, and notable course projects that I’ve developed in my spare time. Feel free to explore the repo if you’re interested!
